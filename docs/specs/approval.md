# Approval: a pure gate for a side-effecting action

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Owner:** `crates/tinyhivemind-core`, with one port in `crates/tinyhivemind`
- **Reading:** [`../research/grok-bots/README.md`](../research/grok-bots/README.md)
- **Decisions:** [ADR 0008](../adr/0008-an-approval-decision-is-total.md),
  [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-a-refusal-renders-what-the-caller-already-holds.md)

## Problem

This library can say who is here, who a mention addresses, who takes the next
turn, and how a room reaches a decision. It cannot say whether the thing that
decision leads to is allowed to happen. There is no approval concept anywhere
in the workspace: not a policy, not a grant, not a verdict type.

The Grok Bot survey found that gap to be the largest one it could evidence.
Six of twelve projects gate side-effecting actions, and in every one of them
the *decision* is already a pure function separated from the IO that enacts it:

- gawkbot's `action.Classify(ClassifyInput{ReadOnly, State, HasGrant})` is a
  switch with no IO returning one of six verdicts, and `actionGrantActive`
  is a fail-closed liveness predicate over `(grant, now)`.
- devspace's `selectAcpPermissionOption(options, writeMode, provider)` is a
  pure choice over a supplied option list; replying to the RPC is a thin
  wrapper around it.
- The reconstructed 0.18 desktop app's `localToolApprovalCovers` is four lines
  deciding whether a stored approval covers a new request, and is reused by
  two processes for that reason.
- OpenBot's computer gateway resolves the target against its own snapshot,
  asks the policy, writes the audit row, and only then acts — in that order,
  because a caller-supplied label otherwise evades "never click Submit".
- The orange book's trigger taxonomy — payment, sensitive action, low
  confidence — is a decidable predicate over an action descriptor.

That is the core/port line this workspace already draws, arrived at
independently five times. The survey also found what happens when the line is
not held: gawkbot's own gate is one long function that classifies, posts a
card, polls, and writes audit inline, and the project ships an ungated local
tool loop beside it that runs `bash` with no check at all.

## Goals

- Decide, from arguments the caller already holds, whether one side-effecting
  action may proceed, must be refused, or has to be put to a person.
- Express a standing grant as a pure liveness and coverage predicate, with no
  clock and no storage of its own.
- Make consent non-retroactive: a grant issued later must not cover a request
  minted earlier.
- Fail closed on every path, including the paths that are ordinarily errors.
- Add no dependency to `crates/tinyhivemind-core`, and no host type anywhere.

## Non-goals

- **Executing anything.** No tool port, no command surface, no process spawn.
  This crate never enacts, and nothing in `ApprovalDecision` schedules work.
- **A policy language.** No CEL, no expression evaluator, no rule DSL. See
  [Why there is no policy language](#why-there-is-no-policy-language).
- **Audit storage.** The host owns the record of what was asked and answered,
  as it owns every other log here. gawkbot's `ApprovalAuditEntry` is the right
  shape and the wrong owner.
- **Credential handling.** No tokens, no secrets, no OAuth. An approver's
  identity arrives as a `Person` already projected by the host.
- **Sandboxing.** The resource predicate defined below is a *lexical* path
  containment test, not a kernel boundary. devspace's `isPathInsideRoot` is
  honest about this and so is this spec: it is a logical fence, and a symlink
  defeats it, because a pure crate cannot call `realpath`.
- **A second dispatch edge.** An `Ask` is not a mention and never becomes a
  `MentionTurnRequest`.

## Proposed behavior

A new `approval` module in `crates/tinyhivemind-core`, sibling to `dispatch`
and `referral`.

### The entry point

```rust
pub fn approve(
    request: &ApprovalRequest,
    policy: &ApprovalPolicy,
    grants: &[StandingGrant],
    refusals: &[RememberedRefusal],
    roster: &Roster<'_>,
    desks: &DeskSet<'_>,
    now: Millis,
) -> ApprovalDecision
```

`refusals` is the host's snapshot of this epoch's remembered refusals, read the
same way `grants` is: the caller already holds it, and the pure fold cannot
enforce step 6 of [Evaluation order](#evaluation-order) without it.

It returns `ApprovalDecision`, not `Result<ApprovalDecision>`. That is a
deliberate departure from this crate's rule that fallible public functions
return `Result<T>`, and it is the subject of
[ADR 0008](../adr/0008-an-approval-decision-is-total.md): a gate that can fail
is a gate that can be bypassed by failing.

`now` is `Millis(u64)`, a host-supplied monotonic reading. There is no clock in
this crate. This is `schedulerJobDue(job, now)`, which the survey records as
gawkbot's canonical due predicate for the same reason.

### The request

```rust
pub struct ApprovalRequest {
    pub epoch: ConsentEpoch,
    pub sequence: u64,
    pub call_id: String,
    pub actor_id: String,
    pub conversation: DispatchConversation,
    pub action: Action,
}

pub struct Action {
    pub verb: String,
    pub target: ActionTarget,
    pub effect: Effect,
}

pub enum ActionTarget {
    Named { name: String },
    Resource { path: String },
}

pub enum Effect { ReadOnly, Mutating, Unclassified }
```

`Effect` is declared by the host, not inferred here. gawkbot infers it from
about forty-five verb tokens, and its own note records the consequence: a
vendor whose action ids use an unanticipated verb slips through classified as
read-only. This crate will not guess. `Effect::Unclassified` is a valid input
and it denies.

`conversation` reuses `DispatchConversation` unchanged, so an action is bound
to the same canonical `(desk_id, thread_root)` pair a dispatch decision binds.

**Trust assumption: `actor_id` is host-authenticated.** `approve` takes it as
a plain field and never verifies it — the same trust boundary
[`mention-dispatch.md`](mention-dispatch.md#trust-assumptions) draws around
`input.hop`. [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-a-refusal-renders-what-the-caller-already-holds.md)'s
claim that `UnknownActor` discloses nothing the caller could not already read
holds only if the host derived `actor_id` from its own authenticated session,
not from a value the caller chose; a host that lets a caller pick its own
`actor_id` turns that variant into a roster oracle, and no code here can catch
the mistake.

### The scope key

```rust
pub struct ScopeKey {
    pub actor_id: String,
    pub call_id: String,
    pub verb: String,
    pub target: ActionTarget,
}
```

This is the reconstruction's `askKey` — one agent, one tool call, one action,
one target — kept here as four typed fields rather than as one joined string.
`ScopeKey::render()` exists only for a host that wants one opaque dedupe token,
and its rendering is collision-free by construction rather than by convention:
each field is length-prefixed before it is written, so an embedded NUL byte in
a `name`, `path`, `verb` or `call_id` cannot be mistaken for a field boundary,
and `ActionTarget`'s variant is written as an explicit leading tag so `Named`
and `Resource` carrying the same string never render the same key. The exact
byte layout is pinned by a serde test.

A grant declares how far past its own call it reaches:

| `GrantScope` | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `Call` | only requests carrying the same `call_id` |
| `Action` | any `call_id`, same `(actor_id, verb, target)` |
| `Resource { root }` | any `call_id`, same `(actor_id, verb)`, and an `ActionTarget::Resource` whose path lies lexically inside `root` |

`Call` is the reconstruction's default and `completeScope` retiring everything
not marked `outlivesScope`; `Action` is that mark; `Resource` is its
`resourcePath` pinning, which is how one grant survives a run of calls touching
the same file or the same terminal folder.

Path containment is devspace's `isPathInsideRoot` written as a pure fold over
already-normalized components: equal to the root, or below it, with any `..`
component anywhere in either path denying outright rather than being resolved.
The crate does not expand `~`, does not resolve symlinks and does not touch a
filesystem, and the rustdoc says so at the predicate itself.

### Standing grants and epochs

```rust
pub struct StandingGrant {
    pub scope: GrantScope,
    pub key: ScopeKey,
    pub granted_at_epoch: ConsentEpoch,
    pub granted_at_sequence: u64,
    pub granted_at: Millis,
    pub expires_at: Option<Millis>,
    pub revoked: bool,
}
```

`grant_live(grant, now, policy)` is a pure predicate, and it is false when the
grant is revoked, when `now >= expires_at`, when `now < granted_at` (a caller
handed a reading from before the grant existed, so the state is inconsistent
and the answer is no), when `expires_at` is `None` and the policy caps grant
lifetime, and when the declared lifetime exceeds `policy.max_grant_ttl`.

That last case **ignores the grant rather than clamping it**. gawkbot clamps to
a thirty-day `maxGrantTTL`. Clamping rewrites the record of what a human
agreed to and then acts on the rewrite; a grant that falls outside current
policy is evidence that policy changed or that the record is wrong, and in
both cases the correct answer is to ask again.

`ConsentEpoch(u64)` is a host-owned monotone counter that advances whenever a
person gives new direction. It carries the correctness property this spec
exists to state:

> A grant covers a request only if `(grant.granted_at_epoch,
> grant.granted_at_sequence) <= (request.epoch, request.sequence)`.

A grant minted at 12:01 does not authorize a call minted at 12:00 that is
still in flight. This is the reconstruction's `alwaysGrantedAtEpoch`, recorded
per agent precisely "so a call minted before the grant does not silently
benefit from it". Without the sequence half, two events inside one epoch order
arbitrarily and the same hole reopens at a finer grain.

A **remembered refusal** is the mirror image and is *not* symmetric:

```rust
pub struct RememberedRefusal {
    pub key: ScopeKey,
    pub scope: GrantScope,
    pub epoch: ConsentEpoch,
}
```

A refusal applies only when `refusal.epoch == request.epoch`. When the epoch
advances, stale refusals stop applying, which is the reconstruction's behavior
and the right one: a grant is a person widening authority and should outlive a
change of subject, while a refusal is a person answering *this* question under
*this* direction, and new direction retires it. The asymmetry is deliberate and
is pinned by a test.

### Policy

```rust
pub struct ApprovalPolicy {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub default: DefaultVerdict,      // Deny | Ask — there is no Allow
    pub rules: Vec<ApprovalRule>,
    pub approver: ApproverRule,
    pub allow_grants: bool,
    pub max_grant_ttl: Option<Millis>,
}

pub enum DefaultVerdict { Deny, Ask }

pub struct ApprovalRule {
    pub effect: Option<Effect>,
    pub verb: Option<String>,
    pub target: Option<TargetPattern>,
    pub verdict: RuleVerdict,        // Deny | Ask | Allow
}

pub enum ApproverRule {
    Person { id: String },
    PerDesk { default: String, overrides: Vec<DeskApprover> },
}
```

`DefaultVerdict` has no `Allow` variant. Fail-closed is a property of the type
here, not of a code path that has to be got right, and `--unsafe` has no
spelling in this API. `enabled: false` denies everything; it is a kill switch,
not a bypass. A host that does not want an action gated does not call
`approve` for it. gawkbot's `WUPHF_UNSAFE=1`, its `--unsafe` flag and its
dry-run skip are each a hole in "every send waits for your click", and none of
them is reproduced.

`ApproverRule::PerDesk` resolves the request's `desk_id` through
`DeskSet::resolve_id` — the existing algebra, including its existing
`UnknownDesk` and `AmbiguousDesk` failures — and then resolves the chosen id
through `Roster::person`. **An approver is always a person.** `Ask` cannot name
an agent, because an agent approving another agent's side effect is not a gate,
it is a second agent. This is the one place where the shape suggested for this
work is narrowed rather than followed.

The two approver-resolution `DenyReason`s are distinct failures, not
synonyms: `UnresolvableApprover` is `DeskSet::resolve_id` itself failing
(`UnknownDesk` or `AmbiguousDesk`) — the desk named by `PerDesk` cannot be
found at all. `NoApprover` is desk resolution succeeding but the id it names —
`PerDesk`'s resolved `default` or override, or a bare `ApproverRule::Person`'s
`id` — not naming an active person in `roster.person`. A `Person` rule can
therefore still deny with `NoApprover`; it is never `UnresolvableApprover`,
because there is no desk lookup to fail.

### The decision

```rust
pub enum ApprovalDecision {
    Allow { basis: AllowBasis },
    Deny { reason: DenyReason },
    Ask { who: String, scope: GrantScope, key: ScopeKey, epoch: ConsentEpoch },
}
```

`Ask` carries the exact scope a grant minted from answering it may claim, so
the host cannot widen a question into a broader standing authority. `Allow`
carries `AllowBasis::Policy` or `AllowBasis::Grant { key }` so a host's audit
row records *why* rather than only *that*. When more than one live grant
covers a request, `key` is the narrowest-scoped covering grant's key
(`Call` before `Action` before `Resource`), and ties within one scope break on
the lowest `(granted_at_epoch, granted_at_sequence)` — the earliest consent
that still covers the request — so the reported basis is a function of the
grant *set*, not of `grants`' order, matching the order-independence invariant
below.

`DenyReason` is enumerated and closed: `Disabled`, `MalformedRequest`,
`UnknownActor`, `UnclassifiedAction`, `PolicyDenied`, `RememberedRefusal`,
`UnresolvableApprover`, `NoApprover`, `NoRule`.

### Evaluation order

Deny beats allow at every level. This is OpenBot's gateway rule — deny beats
allow, absent policy denies, a broken rule denies — and it is deliberately
*not* the first-match-wins ladder `direct_responder` uses, because a ladder
lets a permissive rule placed first hide a restrictive one placed later.

1. `!policy.enabled` → `Deny { Disabled }`.
2. Empty `actor_id`, `call_id`, `verb`, or target string, or a target path with
   a `..` component → `Deny { MalformedRequest }`.
3. `roster.active_member(actor_id)` is `None` → `Deny { UnknownActor }`.
4. `action.effect == Unclassified` → `Deny { UnclassifiedAction }`.
5. Any matching rule with `RuleVerdict::Deny` → `Deny { PolicyDenied }`.
6. A refusal in this epoch whose scope covers the request →
   `Deny { RememberedRefusal }`.
7. `policy.allow_grants` and a live, covering, epoch-eligible grant exists →
   `Allow { Grant }`.
8. Any matching rule with `RuleVerdict::Allow` → `Allow { Policy }`.
9. Any matching rule with `RuleVerdict::Ask`, or `default == Ask` → resolve
   the approver; on success `Ask`, on failure `Deny { UnresolvableApprover }`
   or `Deny { NoApprover }`.
10. Otherwise `Deny { NoRule }`.

### Where the waiting goes

`approve` decides. Nothing in this crate waits for a person, because waiting is
IO and this crate does none.

The waiting belongs behind **one new port in `crates/tinyhivemind`**, sibling
to `MentionTurnQueue` and `ReferralQueue`, not in the host directly:

```rust
pub trait ApprovalGate: Send + Sync {
    async fn ask_once(&self, prompt: ApprovalPrompt) -> Result<ApprovalOutcome>;
}
```

It goes in the runtime crate rather than being left to each host because the
contract it needs is the one two existing ports already state and hosts already
implement: atomically re-read the committed request and current policy,
authorize, and durably record at most once under a key. The key is
`ScopeKey::render()` plus the request sequence, computed purely here — gawkbot
factors out `actionApprovalDedupeKey` with a comment saying it is "pure for
testability", and this is the same key with an owner. `ApprovalOutcome` is
`Asked`, `Already`, or `Answered { decision }`; polling intervals, timeouts,
cards, and the audit row stay with the host.

That port is the second half of this phase and is specified here only in
outline; the pure algebra lands first and is useful without it, because a host
that already has an approval UI needs only the decision.

### One message, one turn

This does not relax the invariant, and it cannot:

- `ApprovalDecision` has no variant that carries a turn, a mention, or a
  `MentionTurnRequest`.
- `Ask` names exactly one person. It is a question put to one addressee, not a
  broadcast to a desk, for the same reason `@everyone` is a list.
- `approve` never consults `direct_responder`, `mention_dispatch` or
  `referral`, and none of them consult it. A host that gates a dispatched turn
  calls `approve` before it calls `dispatch_mention`; the ordering is the
  host's and the library expresses no edge between them.

### Why there is no policy language

CEL, or any embedded expression evaluator, is rejected on four grounds.

1. It is a dependency, and `crates/tinyhivemind-core` takes none that it can
   avoid. An interpreter on the hot path of every gated action is exactly what
   `.github/scripts/assert-pure.sh` exists to keep out.
2. It converts every rule into a string that can fail to parse at evaluation
   time. Under "a broken rule denies", a policy language makes the failure mode
   the common one, and under any other reading it makes it an allow.
3. This crate prefers small typed APIs to stringly-typed ones. `ApprovalRule`
   is three optional matchers and a verdict; anything a host needs beyond that
   it can evaluate itself and hand in as a narrowed `ApprovalPolicy` snapshot.
4. Policy authoring is host configuration. A host with a rules engine keeps it,
   compiles it down, and passes the result — which is the same snapshot-not-
   callback boundary every other type here crosses.

### Rendering a denial

`DenyReason` is the operator's record. The sentence an acting agent reads is
the library's, not the host's, and is bound by
[ADR 0009](../adr/0009-a-refusal-renders-what-the-caller-already-holds.md),
which settles the question this spec previously left open — whether the host
should collapse a reason before rendering it to a model, and which reasons must
collapse.

The rule is that a denial renders a sentence of its own only when what it
discloses is something the caller already holds: the policy it was gated under,
the shape of the request it sent, or its own identity. A denial that turns on
whether a *named other* exists or resolves renders one shared sentence, so a
caller cannot learn a roster by reading which refusal came back. Applying it to
the enumeration above: `Disabled`, `MalformedRequest`, `UnclassifiedAction`,
`PolicyDenied`, `RememberedRefusal`, `NoRule` and `UnknownActor` may be worded
apart — a caller cannot vary its own actor id, so that variant is no more
probeable than `NoDispatchReason::SourceInactive` — while `UnresolvableApprover`
and `NoApprover` turn on a named approver and share one sentence.

ADR 0009 also fixes the mechanics: `Display` carries the agent's sentence and
`Debug` the operator's variant, because the safe rendering has to be the one
`{}` reaches for; the classification is per variant, by its most disclosing
path; and it is pinned by a wildcard-free `match` in a test, so a variant added
later does not compile until its author has classified it. This module supplies
that table and those tests when it lands.

## Invariants and constraints

- **Approval decides, never enacts.** No decision variant performs, schedules,
  or enqueues anything.
- **`approve` is total.** It cannot return an error, so it cannot be bypassed
  by returning one. See ADR 0008.
- **Fail closed.** Every path that does not produce a definite `Allow` produces
  `Deny` or `Ask`; `DefaultVerdict` cannot spell `Allow`; an absent policy, an
  unparsable action, an unknown actor and an unresolvable approver all deny.
- **Consent is not retroactive.** `(grant.granted_at_epoch,
  grant.granted_at_sequence) <= (request.epoch, request.sequence)`, always.
- **Refusals are epoch-local; grants are not.** `refusal.epoch ==
  request.epoch`; a grant survives an epoch advance until it expires.
- **Deny beats allow**, over rules, refusals and malformed input alike.
- **`Ask` names exactly one person**, never an agent and never a list.
- **A grant is never widened.** Coverage is a containment test on the scope
  key: `Action` covers `Call`, `Resource` covers only paths lexically inside
  its root, and nothing covers a different actor.
- **Order independence.** `approve` is a fold: permuting `grants` or
  duplicating an entry does not change the decision.
- **No clock, no storage, no host type, no callback, no async, no new
  dependency.** `now` and `epoch` are arguments. Grants, refusals, audit rows
  and the answer itself are host-owned; nothing here is a second journal.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every `DenyReason` variant has a test that produces it. This module adds no
  variant to the crate-wide `Error`, so the repository's per-error-variant
  coverage rule is discharged against `DenyReason` instead.
- The epoch invariant is pinned by a test that fails if the comparison is
  weakened to `granted_at_epoch <= request.epoch` alone.
- With `enabled: false`, `approve` returns `Deny { Disabled }` for every input
  in the fixture set, asserted rather than documented.
- Wire forms of `ApprovalDecision`, `ScopeKey`, `StandingGrant` and
  `ApprovalPolicy` are pinned, including `ScopeKey::render()`'s NUL joining.
- Every `DenyReason` variant is classified against ADR 0009 by a wildcard-free
  `match`, and the reasons that turn on a named approver render one identical
  sentence.

- `approval_never_produces_a_mention_turn_request`

## Open questions

- **Should `Ask` be able to name a desk's operators as a fallback when the
  named approver is absent?** It would trade a deny for a broader question. The
  spec currently denies, on the grounds that picking a second person to ask is
  a policy choice the host can make by supplying a different `ApproverRule`.
- **Does the sequence half of the epoch fence need a host-visible ordering
  contract?** It assumes request sequences and grant sequences are drawn from
  the same host-owned counter. A host drawing them from two counters gets a
  fence that compares numbers with no relationship, and the library cannot
  detect it.

Whether a `Deny` reason may reach the acting agent, and which reasons must
share one sentence, is no longer open. It is settled by
[ADR 0009](../adr/0009-a-refusal-renders-what-the-caller-already-holds.md); see
[Rendering a denial](#rendering-a-denial).
