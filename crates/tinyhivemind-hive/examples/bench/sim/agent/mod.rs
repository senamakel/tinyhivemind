//! The simulated participant: its state and what it can be told about a

//!
//! [`SimAgent`] itself is defined here so [`Room`](super::Room) and the rest
//! of `sim` have one place to name the type. Its own `impl` is split across
//! two descendant modules by what each method is *for*: [`state`] holds the
//! methods that construct and mutate a member's holdings, and [`turn`] holds
//! the methods that decide what one turn says -- including the
//! [`Participant`](crate::run::Participant) wrapper that lets the host drive
//! it. Splitting by concern rather than declaring one `impl SimAgent` block
//! per file is what a single 2,400-line module would otherwise force.
