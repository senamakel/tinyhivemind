//! Private exchange that does not take the floor.
//!
//! An aside that rides alongside a turn is free but rationed: only the member
//! the attention market authorized may write one, so a room converging in
//! eleven turns writes at most eleven private rows. This module lifts that
//! ration. Between turns, a host may run an **exchange round** in which each
//! eligible member appends at most one private row, taking no floor and
//! producing no turn.
//!
//! The whole safety argument is one property, and it belongs to the algebra
//! rather than to this module: a private row is dropped by the episode's own
//! fold before it can reach a trace, a standing, the sequence they fold at,
//! the directory or the floor, and `EpisodeState::spent` counts turns rather
//! than rows. [`crate::step`] therefore returns the same step — including the
//! state it commits — whether an exchange happened or not, which
//! `tests/fuzz_invariants.rs` asserts over arbitrary transcripts.
//!
//! What a round spends is model calls, not turns. That is a real cost and a
//! host's to authorize, so [`ExchangePolicy`] is off by default and carries
//! two finite ceilings a host can read its worst case off before starting.
//!
//! See [`README.md`][readme] in this directory for the design and the host's
//! obligations, [`docs/specs/off-floor-exchange.md`][spec] for the behavior, and
//! [ADR 0012][adr] for the decision.
