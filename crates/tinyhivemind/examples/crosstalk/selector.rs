//! The model-backed rung of the responder ladder, and asking it who should
//! open the desk.
//!
//! [`LadderSelector`] is the harness's [`Selector`]: given the desk's
//! candidates and the operator's message, it asks the same endpoint the
//! seats run on to name one id. [`route_opening`] is the call site — it
//! resolves the opening instruction's mentions and hands the ladder to
//! `choose_responder`, which validates the answer and falls back
//! deterministically when it is not a candidate.
