# `responder`

The runtime boundary for one optional, tool-less responder-selection call.

## Why it exists

Choosing who answers a message is mostly pure — the responder ladder in
`tinyhivemind-core` already resolves an explicit mention, a single-member desk, or
a disabled selection policy without waiting on anything. The one rung that
cannot be pure is auto-selection: it asks a model to name a candidate. This
module is the whole waiting part of that ladder, held to one call, at most
once, with no transcript, no tools, and no host handles reachable from inside
it.

## Public surface

| Item | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Selector` | trait a host implements to name one candidate id from a `SelectionRequest` |
| `SelectorFuture<'a>` | the boxed, executor-neutral future `Selector::select` returns |
| `BoxError` | a boxed failure returned by a host selector implementation |
| `choose_responder(selector, request, roster, desks, candidate_details)` | run the ladder, calling `selector` at most once |
| re-exported from `tinyhivemind_core::responder` | `ResponderDecision`, `ResponderPlan`, `ResponderRequest`, `ResponderRung`, `SelectionDisposition`, `SelectionPolicy`, `SelectionRequest`, `SelectorCandidate`, `accept_selection`, `responder_plan` |

`responder_plan` (pure, in `tinyhivemind-core`) does the actual ladder walk and
returns either an already-`Decided` decision or a `Select` request describing
exactly what to ask a model. `choose_responder` is the thin async shell around
it: call the selector if one exists and the plan asks for it, validate the
output, and fall back on absence, failure, or an invalid answer.

## Constraints worth knowing

- **At most one call, ever.** `choose_responder` invokes `selector.select`
  exactly once when the pure plan requires selection, and not at all otherwise
  — an already-decided rung, a `None` selector, or an empty candidate list all
  short-circuit before any call is made. This mirrors the charter's one
  message, one turn rule at the responder layer: auto-selection asks a model
  once and accepts what comes back or falls through.
- **Selector failure is not a runtime error.** A future that resolves to
  `Err` is treated exactly like invalid output: it moves to the desk-default
  fallback with an appropriate `SelectionDisposition`, rather than propagating
  through `Result`. Only a reached fallback with no active responder, or a
  typed pure-algebra failure from snapshot validation, is a real `Error`.
- **The trait is object-safe and borrow-friendly.** `Selector::select` takes
  `&'a self` and `&'a SelectionRequest`, and its returned future shares that
  lifetime, so an implementation may hold either borrow across an `.await`
  without forcing an owned clone. `BorrowingSelector` in the tests exercises
  this directly.
- **The selector sees no transcript and no tools.** `SelectionRequest` carries
  only the raw message, the canonical desk id, and the bounded effective
  candidates the pure core already assembled — nothing here hands a selector a
  host handle, a log reader, or a way to act.

## Where the result goes

`ResponderDecision` is the runtime's answer to "who replies to this message";
a host reads its `responder_id` and `rung` to route the next turn, and its
`disposition` to decide whether to log or surface a fallback.
