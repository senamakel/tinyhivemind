//! Which byte ranges of a message body are code, and so carry no grammar.
//!
//! The mention grammar here and the stigmergic trace grammar in
//! `tinyhivemind-hive` read the *same* message body. While each carried its
//! own scanner they could disagree about which span of that body is code, and
//! a marker one grammar read as quoted documentation the other read as a live
//! instruction. This module is the one scanner they share.
//!
//! # Two levels of masking, and why
//!
//! [`fenced_ranges`] masks fenced code blocks only. [`code_ranges`] masks
//! those *and* inline code spans. A grammar picks the level its markers
//! need:
//!
//! - A **line-leading** grammar — one whose marker only counts at the start of
//!   a line, like `!propose` or a pin directive — needs fences alone. A marker
//!   preceded by an inline backtick is by definition not line-leading, so
//!   inline masking would only cost a scan.
//! - A **mid-line** grammar — a mention, which may appear anywhere in a
//!   sentence — needs both. `` `@alice` `` is a name in prose about a name,
//!   not a ping.
//!
//! # Fence rules
//!
//! [`fenced_ranges`] covers both of `CommonMark`'s code block kinds, closely
//! enough that an author who formats a message for a Markdown renderer gets
//! the masking they see:
//!
//! - an opening fence is indented at most three spaces, and is a run of at
//!   least three backticks or at least three tildes;
//! - a backtick opener's info string may not contain a backtick, because that
//!   is an inline span in a paragraph rather than a block;
//! - a closing fence uses the same character as its opener, runs at least as
//!   long, and carries nothing but whitespace after the run;
//! - an unclosed fence masks to the end of the body, so a body cannot end
//!   mid-block with its tail read as grammar;
//! - a line indented four or more columns — a tab expands to the next
//!   multiple of four — opens an [indented code block][indented-spec] instead,
//!   which is why a fence at that indentation never opens a fenced one — but
//!   its content is still `CommonMark` code, so [`fenced_ranges`] masks it
//!   too, and a directive quoted inside one cannot reach a line-leading
//!   grammar;
//! - an indented block cannot interrupt a paragraph: the indented *opener*
//!   must be the first line of the body or follow a blank line, so a wrapped,
//!   indented continuation line right after live text stays live rather than
//!   being read as a new block.
//!
//! # Inline span rules
//!
//! [`code_ranges`] adds `CommonMark`'s [code spans][span-spec] to that:
//!
//! - a span opens on a run of backticks and closes on the next run of
//!   *exactly* the same length, so `` ``a`b`` `` is one span rather than two;
//! - a backslash escapes the backtick after it, so `` \` `` opens nothing —
//!   but a backslash inside an open span is content, and does not stop the
//!   span closing on the backtick it precedes;
//! - a span is inline content of one block, so pairing stops at the boundary
//!   the opener's paragraph ends on: a blank line, a fenced or indented code
//!   block, an ATX heading, a thematic break, or a setext underline. Without
//!   that stop, one stray backtick early in a message and another far below
//!   it would silence every mention in between.
//!
//! Block boundaries a container introduces — a list item or a blockquote
//! interrupting a paragraph — are not recognised, for the same reason the
//! indented-block rule ignores containers.
//!
//! The indented-block rule measures from the message's left margin, not from
//! inside a list or blockquote container the way a full `CommonMark` parser
//! would, so a body that nests one inside a list can, in principle, be masked
//! differently than a renderer would show it — see the private
//! `indented_block_ranges` helper's doc comment in this module's source for
//! why that trade is made rather than growing this into a block-level parser.
