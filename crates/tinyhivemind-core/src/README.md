# Feature modules

One directory per feature area, each answering one question from a fold over
arguments the caller supplies. `lib.rs` re-exports all of them and carries the
crate-level overview; this file is just an index pointing at each module's own
README.

| module | question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [`aside`](aside/README.md) | how a private, off-transcript note is scoped to the readers it names |
| [`chat`](chat/README.md) | which stored chat id names which conversation, and which four spellings mean the default desk |
| [`desk`](desk/README.md) | what a desk is, and who is on it once the declared blueprint is merged with runtime overlays |
| [`dispatch`](dispatch/README.md) | does one committed reply start a child turn, and for whom |
| [`error`](error/README.md) | the crate-wide `Error` enum and `Result` alias every fallible function returns |
| [`find`](find/README.md) | what one ranked name search over a roster or desk snapshot returns |
| [`masking`](masking/README.md) | which spans of a message body are fenced or inline code, so no grammar parses inside them |
| [`mention`](mention/README.md) | who does an authored `@` name address, resolved against the live roster and desks |
| [`referral`](referral/README.md) | does one turn cross to another desk, and how its one answer carries back |
| [`responder`](responder/README.md) | which single agent answers one message, walking the deterministic ladder |
| [`roster`](roster/README.md) | who is here — active, retired, or tombstoned agents and the people signed in with them |
| [`select`](select/README.md) | the one ranking every picker in the workspace shares |
